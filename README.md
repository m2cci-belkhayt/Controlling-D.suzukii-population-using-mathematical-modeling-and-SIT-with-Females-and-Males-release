 # Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) for Controlling *Drosophila Suzukii by Releasing sterile Males and Females*

Welcome to the README for our research project on the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) applied to *Drosophila Suzukii* populations. In this repository, we explore the dynamics of *D. suzukii* populations when both sterile females and males are released into the environment, comparing this strategy to the traditional male-only release approach. Our research utilizes Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) modeling to understand the effectiveness of these release strategies in pest management.

## Introduction

Traditionally, the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) has primarily focused on the release of sterilized males to disrupt the reproduction of target pests. Male mosquitoes, in many cases, are harmless as they do not bite or feed on blood (*Aedes aegypti*) or lay eggs (*Drosophila Suzukii*). By releasing sterile male mosquitoes into the environment, it is possible to reduce the population of the species without increasing biting activity in human populations or harming agricultural yields. However, *Drosophila Suzukii* poses unique challenges due to the time-consuming process of sexing. This research evaluates the impact and effectiveness of SIT when both sterile males and females are released.

## Modeling Population Dynamics

Our research begins with the development of an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model to capture the dynamics of *Drosophila Suzukii* populations. We employ a step-by-step modeling approach, starting with a basic model and iteratively adding hypotheses and dimensions to create a comprehensive model. This approach includes factors such as remating ability, preferences, and other biological aspects related to the fly's behavior.

The research focuses on modeling the population dynamics of *Drosophila Suzukii* without releasing sterile flies initially, using a model with three cohorts. We analyze and simulate this model and gradually introduce complexity by adding compartments that describe the population dynamics more broadly, incorporating remating ability for female flies.

## Incorporating Sterile Flies

Chapter 3 of our research extends the modeling approach to include the release of sterile flies into the population. This chapter is divided into two sections: one dealing with the release of only males and the other with the release of both males and females. The hypothesis made in the modeling were first infinit mating, second once mating, last remating once in a while, last but not least a model that studies that could study the preferences. We conduct analyses and simulations to explore how these different release strategies impact overall population growth and reproductive success. 

## Conclusion and Insights

The final chapter of our research summarizes our findings and draws conclusions. We provide insights into the efficacy of the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) as applied to *Drosophila Suzukii* pest management. Additionally, we highlight the most effective release strategy that can inform the design of more targeted and efficient pest management strategies.

This research represents a significant advancement in the field, offering valuable insights into the application of the SIT technique for controlling *Drosophila Suzukii*. We hope that this work contributes to the development of more sustainable and effective pest control strategies.
